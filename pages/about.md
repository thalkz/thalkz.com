# About

Hi, my name is Roland and I'm passionate about code, product design, and entrepreneurship. I've worked for 5 years on building [Neopolis](https://neopolis.io), a mobile game that uses real-world data as game assets, as well as the company around it alongside two co-founders: Lucas and Ben. More info can be found on [Revolt Games's website](https://revoltgames.io).

More recently, I have joined [amo](https://amo.co/) to help build the best social apps, and especially the best social map on [Bump](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.amo.android.location). Since joining, I've been doing mostly Kotlin and enjoying it a lot!

I always have one or two side projects in the making, and (thankfully) some make it to the working stage. I mainly write stuff in Flutter, Go, and TypeScript, and more recently: Kotlin. I plan to share some of them on this website, happy reading!
