Hi, my name is Roland and I'm passionate about code, product design, and entrepreneurship. I've worked since 2018 on building [Neopolis](https://neopolis.io), a mobile game that uses real-world data as game assets, as well as the company around it alongside two co-founders: Lucas and Ben. More info can be found on [Revolt Games's website](https://revoltgames.io).

I always have one or two side projects in the making, and (thankfully) some make it to working stage. I mainly write stuff in Flutter, Go, and Typescript. I plan to share some of them on this website, happy reading! If you don't know where to start, the projects marked with a ⭐️ are my very favorite.
