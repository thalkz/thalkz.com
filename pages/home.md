# Thalkz's Portfolio

Hi, my name is Roland and I'm passionate about code, product design and entrepreneurship. I've worked since 2018 on building [Neopolis](https://neopolis.io), a mobile game that uses real-world data as game assets, as well as  the compagny around it with my two co-founders: Lucas and Ben. More info can be found on [Revolt Games's website](https://revoltgames.io).

I always have one or two side-projects in the making, and (thankfully) some actually make it to "working" stage. I mainly write stuff in Flutter, Go and Typescript. I plan to share some of them on this website.

## About

The source-code of this website can be found on [github](https://github.com/thalkz), and is representative of my design and programming philosophy: keep things simple. For side-projects, I try to build things myself, which means avoid high-level frameworks or libraries as much as possible. 

Some of my inspirations for this website are [Ryan Jacobs' blog](https://blog.notryan.com/), the [Designed to Last](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/) post, and the excellent [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).
