# Thalkz's Portfolio

Hi, my name is Roland and I'm passionate about code, product design and entrepreneurship. I've worked since 2018 on building [Neopolis](https://neopolis.io), a mobile game that uses real-world data as game assets, as well as the compagny around it alongside two co-founders: Lucas and Ben. More info can be found on [Revolt Games's website](https://revoltgames.io).

I always have one or two side-projects in the making, and (thankfully) some actually make it to working stage. I mainly write stuff in Flutter, Go and Typescript. I plan to share some of them on this website.
