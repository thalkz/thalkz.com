The correct way to add values to a `Map` in JavaScript is with the `map.set(key, value)` function. Using the `map[key]=value` notation seems to work at first, but the key-value pair is ignored by methods on the Map, like `map.has(key)` and `map.delete(keys)`.

Maps and Objects are not the same thing. They are similar In the fact that they are both key-value pairs. But there are notable differences :
- an Object contains values by default (prototype)
- an Object is vulnerable to object injection attacks, so a Map is safer
- any value can be used as key in a Map. For Objects, only String and Symbols are allowed
- Map is iterable and the keys are ordered in the order they were created
- Map has a size property
- Map has better performances when adding & removing many keys

`Map` was added with ES6 (2015) and is not supported by all browsers.
