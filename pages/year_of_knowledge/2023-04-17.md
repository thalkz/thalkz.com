Flutter is composed of two parts :
- the Flutter Framework, written in Dart
- the Flutter Engine, written in C/C++

Both parts communicate via an abstraction layer, called FlutterWindow. This abstraction layer provides an API to communicate to the device and also allows the Engine to notify the Framework of :
- device events (orientation changes, device settings changes, memory issues, etc)
- user gestures (taps, swipes, etc)
- platform channels
- most importantly: when the engine is ready to render a new frame
