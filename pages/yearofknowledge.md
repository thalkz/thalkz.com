# Year of Knowledge
* Date: 2023
* Tech: Obsidian, Webdav
* The 365 notes: [Will be published later]

A year of learning one thing per day on different subjects, including learnings when traveling in Europe

## Motivation
The Year of Knownledge is part of my [yearly theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE&ab_channel=CGPGrey) for 2023. The theme being purposfully vague, I've taken a bit of time to figure out how to concretely work towards this theme. Then, it clicked: just write something I learned each day, whatever it is. Like most people, I remember information much better when I've done the job of summurizing it and writing it down.

## The setup
To achieve 365 days of writing something new each day, I needed to have an editor both on my phone and my computer. The phone for most days, accessible from anywhere, and the computer mostly for editing, for longer inputs, or simply when I was in the mood for it.

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) turned out to be perfect for that purpose: the text editor is simple and powerful and the text is plain markdown. Obsidian has a paid synchronization feature, that looks very well made and completely worth it most cases. Still, I started looking for alternatives and handle the sync "myself". After a quick failed attempt of using Git, I setteled with the community plugin [Remotely Save](https://github.com/remotely-save/remotely-save) and a WebDAV server on my VPS, using a nice Go implementation of the protocol: [dave](https://github.com/micromata/dave) (now unmaintained).

## To be continued
At the time of writing, I'm about 7 months into this project. I will cleanup un upload my notes at some point, and maybe add some statistics & other findings.
